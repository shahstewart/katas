Hi,

I am Sangeeta :wave:. While I am busy training in other fields, I keep my programming muscles from waning by practicing katas. I created this repository because I thought, if I am doing the work, I might as well share it with the community.  

I will write solutions to each kata in one or more languages. The languages I will be using are: JavaScript, Python, PHP, Go and R.

Where ever possible, I will try to add unit tests as well. 

Hope someone finds these katas useful :pray:.
