Hi,

I am Sangeeta :wave:. While I am busy training in other fields, I keep my programming muscles from waning by practicing katas. I created this repository because I thought, if I am doing the work, I might as well share it with the community.  

I will write solutions to each kata in one or more languages. The languages I will be using are: JavaScript, Python, PHP, Go and R.

Each Kata will be in its own directory with its own `readme.md` file that will describe the kata, and the types of solutions provided. Whenever possible, I will add unit tests and a note in readme.md on how to run those tests. 

Hope someone finds these katas useful :pray:.
