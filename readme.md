Hi,

I am Sangeeta :wave:. While I am busy elsewhere, I keep my fingers nimble by practicing katas. I created this repository because I thought, I am doing the work, I might as well share it with the community.  

I will add katas in one or more languages based on their suitability of the specific kata. The languages I will be using are: JavaScript, Python, PHP, Go, R.

Where ever possible, I will try to add unit tests as well. 

Hope someone finds these katas useful :pray:.
