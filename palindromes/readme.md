## Is it a palindrome?

#### Description
Write a function to determine if a given string is a palindrome. This question is often encountered 
during technical interviews. I thought it might be worth including it here.


#### Tests
_JavaScript:_ with _mocha_, run `mocha test.js` from the js folder (`katas/palindromes/js`)

_Python:_ with _pytest_,  run `py.test` from the python folder (`katas/palindromes/python`)

_php:_ with _phpunit_, run  `..\..\vendor\bin\phpunit TestPalindromes.php` from the php folder (`katas/palindromes/php`)
