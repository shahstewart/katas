## Is it a palindrome?

### Description
Write a function to determine if a given string is a palindrome. This question is often encountered 
during technical interviews. I thought it might be worth including it here.


### Tests
**JavaScript:** with _mocha_, run `mocha test.js` from the js folder (`katas/programming/palindromes/js`)

**Python:** with _pytest_,  run `py.test` from the python folder (`katas/programming/palindromes/python`)

**php:** with _phpunit_, run  `..\..\..\vendor\bin\phpunit TestIsPalindrome.php` from the php folder 
(`katas/programming/palindromes/php`)
