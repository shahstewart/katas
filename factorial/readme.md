## Factorial

#### Description
Factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers before it.  
For example, factorial five (written mathematically as 5!) can be calculated as  
  
``5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5  = 120``  

#### Solution
The solution added here is a recursive, linear (_O(n)_) solution.  

#### tests
_JavaScript:_ install mocha globally and run `mocha test.js` from the corresponding js folder (`katas/factorial/js`)  

_Python:_ install pytest using pip: `pip install pytest` and run `py.test` from the python folder (`katas/factorial/python`)  

_php:_ install phpunit (`composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit`). From the `katas/factorial/php` folder run:  
`..\..\vendor\bin\phpunit TestFactorial.php`.
